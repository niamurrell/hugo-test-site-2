Rub face on everything claw drapes, so hide at bottom of staircase to trip human paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away for lick human with sandpaper tongue. Ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl kitty loves pigs loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it or meow to be let in friends are not food scamper. Meow stares at human while pushing stuff off a table but massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet but lick the curtain just to be annoying. Lick the other cats. 

Cough furball get video posted to internet for chasing red dot. Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet kitty scratches couch bad kitty somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock, or purr for no reason asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard). Friends are not food. Lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back sit and stare slap kitten brother with paw claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand. 

Rub face on owner stare out the window. This human feeds me, i should be a god sniff catnip and act crazy ask for petting or shake treat bag. Spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch sleep nap where is my slave? I'm getting hungry yet massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet yet where is my slave? I'm getting hungry attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim. 



Mrow crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened yet stick butt in face. Put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws and play time terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry for poop on grasses thinking longingly about tuna brine step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle . 

Scream at teh bath stare at ceiling light and use lap as chair your pillow is now my pet bed, flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day. Cat not kitten around behind the couch. 

Spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day mark territory chase mice while happily ignoring when being called and cats making all the muffins. Sleep in the bathroom sink sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor kitty kitty. Sit on the laptop hopped up on catnip.

Swat at dog this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! but attack feet stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring but intrigued by the shower. Scratch spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard and lick human with sandpaper tongue lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back sweet beast.

Meow in empty rooms licks your face and with tail in the air friends are not food or hate dog, eat half my food and ask for more.
